# Terraform provisioning

The root `azure.yaml` runs `azd provision` against this directory and `azd deploy` for five Linux App Services: account, payment, transaction, the Responses BFF, and the web frontend. The hosted agent has its own `app/agent/azure.yaml` and is not an App Service or a Terraform resource in this stack. Terraform uses an existing resource group and provisions one shared Linux plan, five web sites, Log Analytics, Application Insights, Blob storage, PostgreSQL, and a dedicated Foundry account and project. The separate Foundry azd project deploys the hosted agent; it consumes the project endpoint provisioned here.

This stack intentionally omits Cosmos DB and Document Intelligence. Foundry Responses maintains conversation state when requests link turns with a `conversation` ID or `previous_response_id`; the BFF binds those conversations to the authenticated user. Before production use, verify the hosted agent and BFF identities have only the required Foundry permissions. Do not import role assignments targeting the removed legacy backend App Service identity for a different principal. Blob storage is still provisioned for existing business-service compatibility and remains publicly reachable unless a private endpoint or VNet path is designed separately.

## Prerequisites

Select a single subscription, resource group, and azd environment. The resource group and the remote-state storage account/container must already exist before the first provision; do not put application data in the state container. Grant the Terraform identity Storage Blob Data Contributor on the state container and appropriate permissions to provision resources in the resource group. Authenticate with Azure CLI as well as azd (`azd config set auth.useAzCliAuth true`), then set these azd values: `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `AZURE_LOCATION`, `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `RS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, and `RS_CONTAINER_NAME`. `AZURE_ENV_NAME` comes from the selected azd environment. Keep the state storage in the selected resource group. The remote state key is `banking-assistant.tfstate`; use one state for the one environment. The Terraform state backend uses Microsoft Entra authentication and Azure Blob lease locking.

The root Terraform files use `main.tfvars.json` for azd interpolation and `provider.conf.json` for remote state; do not put credentials in either file. For direct Terraform commands, pass equivalent variables in an untracked `.tfvars` file and initialize with `-backend-config` using real state account/container values instead of the `${...}` azd placeholders. Never commit state, plans, or secret values. The checked-in lock file pins resolved provider versions. The new Foundry account is created with system-assigned identity and project management enabled from its first request; the project-management setting cannot be enabled retroactively on an existing account.

## Existing resources

The checked-in `main.tfvars.json` sets `postgres_location = "centralus"` because
the East US 2 PostgreSQL capacity request was denied, and this provisioning path was
validated successfully in Central US. Only PostgreSQL uses this override; App
Services, storage, monitoring, and Foundry retain the existing resource group region.
A null or omitted override uses the resource group region. Direct Terraform runs must
also pass `postgres_location = "centralus"` in their local variable file.

PostgreSQL server and database names are resolved from azd environment variables in
`main.tfvars.json` (`${POSTGRES_SERVER_NAME}` and `${POSTGRES_DATABASE_NAME}`) rather
than hardcoded values. The current low-cost baseline is Burstable
`B_Standard_B1ms` with `postgres_storage_mb = 32768` (32 GiB), which is the minimum
supported storage size returned by the Central US Burstable SKU catalog for this
subscription at provisioning time. If latency or throughput becomes a bottleneck,
increase `postgres_sku_name` (for example to `B_Standard_B2s` or `B_Standard_B2ms`)
and reprovision.

Cross-region database access adds latency and may incur data-transfer charges.
Catalog support and `terraform validate` do not guarantee capacity at creation time.
Changing the region of an existing server requires replacement and a separate data
migration.

PostgreSQL Flexible Server has `publicNetworkAccess = "Enabled"`, but the only firewall
rule created by default (`AllowAllAzureServicesAndResourcesWithinAzureIps`, the special
`0.0.0.0`/`0.0.0.0` range) permits Azure-hosted resources only, not an arbitrary public
IP. To reach the server directly from a local client such as pgAdmin, set the azd
environment value `POSTGRES_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IP` to that single public IP
(`azd env set POSTGRES_ALLOWED_CLIENT_IP <your-ip>`) before provisioning; `main.tfvars.json`
forwards it to `postgres_allowed_client_ip`, which creates one extra `AllowLocalClientIp`
firewall rule. Leave the value unset to keep the server reachable only from Azure. Rotate
or remove this value (and reprovision) whenever the allowed IP changes.

Before enabling `azd provision` against an existing Bicep deployment, inspect the actual resource IDs and names. Set `app_names` and the storage name override for existing resources; set `hostname_scope = null` when importing sites created without a unique hostname. Azure only accepts the unique hostname scope on site creation; changing it on an existing site requires replacing that site. Back up the existing deployment and Terraform state before any cutover. Import each managed resource (the plan, existing sites, monitoring, storage account, and container) with `terraform import -var-file=<local.tfvars> <address> <resource-id>` after initializing remote state. Example Terraform addresses: `azurerm_service_plan.main`, `azapi_resource.app["account"]`, `azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.main`, `azurerm_application_insights.main`, `azurerm_storage_account.content`, and `azurerm_storage_container.content`. The Responses BFF is a new dedicated resource at `azapi_resource.responses_bff`; do not import an unrelated backend site at that address. Terraform does not automatically import Bicep-managed resources. Review `terraform plan` for **zero unexpected deletes or replacements** before running `azd provision`. Do not run Bicep and Terraform provisioning concurrently on the same resources.

The app names, derived web URLs, and infrastructure settings are emitted as Terraform outputs for azd. Do not derive a web URL from the site name when unique hostnames are enabled; consume the `defaultHostName` output. The root environment also receives `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`, `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`, `AZURE_RESPONSES_BFF_NAME`, and `RESPONSES_BFF_URI`. The web frontend receives the BFF `/responses` URL at build time. `azd deploy --cwd app/agent` is the separate hosted-agent deploy path; plain root `azd deploy` targets only the five App Services.

Terraform deliberately omits `JWT_SECRET_KEY` and configures the BFF with the shared
PostgreSQL `DATABASE_URL`. Before deploying the BFF, configure the GitHub Environment
secret `RESPONSES_BFF_JWT_SECRET`, then use `.github/workflows/cd-responses-bff.yaml`, or
set the App Service secret through an equivalent secret-management path. Account and
Transaction verify that same browser-issued JWT directly for their REST endpoints, so
`cd-account.yaml` and `cd-transaction.yaml` set the identical `JWT_SECRET_KEY` value from
the same `RESPONSES_BFF_JWT_SECRET` secret; keep all three services' value in sync. Terraform
sets `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` for Account and Transaction to the deployed web app's origin
directly (no secret involved), alongside the existing native App Service CORS configuration.
The BFF identity
receives `Foundry Agent Consumer` and a custom project-scoped role containing
`Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/agents/UserIdentityImpersonation/action`. Do not send
Azure credentials or the delegated identity header from the browser.

By convention in this repository, the frontend App Service name is `app-banking-web-<env>` (for example, `app-banking-web-development`). Keep this explicit naming when adding environments so the web workload is distinguishable from account/payment/transaction services.

## Checks

Run `terraform fmt -check -recursive` and `terraform validate` after initializing the providers. `terraform plan` and `azd provision` require Azure credentials, a pre-created backend, and the selected subscription; validation alone does not create or import any Azure resources. `azd deploy` requires successfully provisioned App Services and a working zip/build pipeline for the frontend and each service. Do not run `azd down` on the existing resource group as a rollback strategy.
