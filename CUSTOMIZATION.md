# Agent Customization

The active workflow contains a triage agent plus Account and Transaction specialists. It is built in [`app/agent/app/agents/azure_chat/hosted_workflow.py`](app/agent/app/agents/azure_chat/hosted_workflow.py) and served through Foundry Responses by [`app/agent/app/main_responses_host.py`](app/agent/app/main_responses_host.py).

## Supported Changes

- Refine triage, Account, or Transaction instructions.
- Adjust handoff descriptions between those agents.
- Add or refine tools on the existing Account and Transaction MCP servers.
- Improve generic MCP approval rendering and submission in the Responses frontend.

Adding another specialist, reconnecting Payment, or restoring ChatKit changes the locked architecture and requires explicit approval first.

## Agent Changes

1. Update the owning agent or workflow module under `app/agent/app/agents/azure_chat`.
2. Keep agent instructions and MCP tool names and descriptions in English.
3. Preserve `FoundryChatClient`, `HandoffBuilder`, and the Responses host boundary.
4. Keep MCP calls async and avoid opening connections during module import or workflow construction.
5. Add focused coverage to `app/agent/tests/test_hosted_workflow.py` when behavior changes.

Run:

```powershell
cd app/agent
uv run pytest tests/test_hosted_workflow.py tests/test_settings.py -q
```

## Tool Changes

Keep `mcp_tools.py` as a thin schema and delegation layer. Put business rules, data access, and customer-resource authorization in the corresponding `services.py`. Do not alter the Payment service as part of active workflow changes.

## Browser Contract

The frontend signs in through the existing BFF login and sends messages and generic approval results to `/responses` through the BFF. The BFF validates the application JWT, binds the conversation to that user, and calls the local or hosted agent with server-side Azure credentials. Do not add a second or fake login path, direct browser-to-agent calls, ChatKit event envelopes, attachment upload flows, or mock session tokens.

Validate frontend changes with:

```powershell
cd app/frontend/banking-web
npm run lint
npm run build
```
