# Architecture Decision Records

One ADR per significant, hard-to-reverse decision — the problem, the alternatives
weighed, the choice made, and its consequences. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) for the current state of the system these
decisions produced; read these records for _why_, not _how it works today_.

| ADR                                                                 | Decision                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [0001](0001-single-workflow-scope-with-dispute-support-case.md)     | Single workflow scope: Account/Transaction inquiries with one transaction-dispute support case layer |
| [0002](0002-deterministic-fraud-score-triage-over-trained-model.md) | Deterministic `fraud_score` threshold triage instead of training a new fraud-detection model         |
| [0003](0003-postgresql-as-the-operational-data-store.md)            | PostgreSQL as the operational data store for the live tool-calling path                              |
| [0004](0004-custom-jwt-authentication-over-entra-id.md)             | Custom email/password JWT authentication instead of Microsoft Entra ID                               |
| [0005](0005-frontend-calls-account-and-transaction-directly.md)     | Frontend calls Account and Transaction directly; BFF trimmed to identity and agent proxy             |

Once a record's `Status` is `Accepted`, its Context/Decision/Consequences are
immutable. A changed decision gets a new ADR that supersedes the old one; the old
record's `Status` is updated to `Superseded`, never edited in place.
