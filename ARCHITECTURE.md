# Architecture of the Banking Assistant Prototype

## Bird's Eye View

This is an AI-first banking customer-service prototype built for the Factored AI &
Data Hackathon 2026, extending the public
`Azure-Samples/agent-openai-python-banking-assistant` sample. It implements one
coherent workflow: Account/Transaction inquiries through a conversational agent, with
a single persisted support-case layer on top for transaction disputes.

The system combines a React frontend, a database-free Responses BFF that owns the
browser trust boundary, dedicated Identity for credentials and lifecycle, a Responses
agent (Microsoft Agent Framework `HandoffBuilder`, served through Foundry Responses)
for triage and conversation, and two FastMCP business services (Account, Transaction)
for financial data and business rules. PostgreSQL is the only operational data store;
Terraform defines the five-site App Service stack separately from the hosted agent.

The one deliberate architectural split to internalize before changing anything: the
BFF is scoped to identity and chat-proxying only. The browser calls Account and
Transaction directly over REST for every financial read (accounts, cards,
transactions, support cases); it never goes through the BFF for those. The BFF is
only in the loop for allowlisted login/profile/admin facades and the customer
Responses chat stream. Dedicated Identity owns credentials, profiles and lifecycle;
the BFF has no database connection.

## Code Map

### `app/frontend/banking-web/`

React + Vite + shadcn-ui. `src/api/` holds `authClient.ts` (BFF login/profile),
`financialClient.ts` (Account/Transaction direct reads), `disputeClient.ts`
(customer support cases), and `operatorDisputeClient.ts` (operator queue/detail,
exclusive claim, versioned verdicts, effects retry and card protection). Transaction clients call its absolute `VITE_*_API_URL`
origin directly with the application JWT, never through a dev-server proxy.
`src/pages/` holds one page per screen, including `SupportCases.tsx`,
`SupportCaseDetail.tsx` and role-guarded `OperatorCases.tsx`. `src/locales/` holds the static `en`/`es`/`pt` UI catalogs
consumed by `UiLocaleProvider`. `src/components/DisputePreviewConsent.tsx` shares
proposal context, accept/decline and bounded recovery between `ReportDisputeDialog`
and the chat `DisputePreview` widget. Legacy `DisputeConsent` handles only persisted
pending-case decisions; generic MCP permission controls remain separate.

### `app/responses-bff/src/bff/`

`main.py` wires the FastAPI app. `auth.py` fronts allowlisted Identity
operations and checks current active identity/version without caching. `responses.py`
proxies the customer-only Responses SSE stream to the local or Foundry-hosted agent.
`internal_identity.py` signs the verified identity envelope the agent re-verifies.
`credentials.py` obtains the Azure access token server-side for hosted mode. This
package does not import or query Account/Transaction/PostgreSQL financial tables;
see [ADR 0005: Direct frontend financial API calls](docs/adr/0005-frontend-calls-account-and-transaction-directly.md)
for the boundary decision.

### `app/business-api/identity/src/identity/`

Dedicated FastAPI identity service: Argon2 login, HS256 issuance, customer/operator/
admin profiles, fixed-role operator management, active/inactive lifecycle, identity
version and atomic audit. Access JWTs default to 60 minutes; refresh sessions and
renewal modals are deferred. An explicit seed service bootstraps an admin from external
credentials; it never runs at startup. Protected introspection uses a separate
`AUTH_INTERNAL_SECRET`. Staff have no `customer_id` and cannot use customer
financial REST or customer chat; operator-role review endpoints are a separate
boundary. See [ADR 0006: Dedicated auth users and staff identities](docs/adr/0006-dedicated-auth-users-and-staff-identities.md).

### `app/agent/src/app/`

`main_responses_host.py` is the Responses entry point, local and hosted.
`agents/azure_chat/hosted_workflow.py` builds the triage + Account + Transaction
specialist agents as one `HandoffBuilder` workflow using `FoundryChatClient` and MCP
tools; it constructs a request-local workflow per call to avoid shared mutable
executor state. `context/user_profile_provider.py` injects authenticated locale and
localized human-label instructions. Transaction intake requires preview and explicit
consent before mutation; REST-accepted cases continue via `getSupportCase` readback.
`tools/` holds the MCP client wiring. `routers/` exposes the local
`/responses` endpoint that the BFF proxies to.

### `app/business-api/account/src/banking_account/` and `app/business-api/transaction/src/banking_transaction/`

Both expose `mcp_tools.py` (agent-only tools via `auth/internal_identity.py`'s
fresh 60-second bearer), `routers/` (browser REST via `auth/jwt_identity.py`),
`services/` (business logic and resource ownership), `projections/` (read DTO
assembly), and `models/` (Pydantic DTOs, not canonical tables).
Transaction's `services/disputes.py`, `consent/preview.py` and `routers/disputes.py`
own customer proposals, consent, routing and `/api/support-cases`.
`services/operator.py` coordinates claims, verdicts and recorded effects;
`services/adjudication.py` applies effects without owning commits.
`routers/operator.py`, `auth/operator_identity.py` and `models/operator.py`
define the separate operator-role REST boundary and DTOs.
Both REST boundaries validate application JWTs and check current Identity; customer
ownership and operator assignment/version rules remain in service code. Read-only preview precedes explicit consent; signed-token
acceptance atomically creates the case, consent and routing in `IN_REVIEW`, while
preview/decline create no case/events. Acceptance lasts ten minutes; read-only recovery
lasts 24 hours from issuance and never treats null as proof of a failed write.
Legacy `WAITING_USER_APPROVAL` cases retain their decision path. See the
[Transaction consent contract](app/business-api/transaction/README.md).
A score never resolves a case. [ADR 0008: Operator ownership without the service-agent catalog](docs/adr/0008-operator-ownership-without-service-agent-catalog.md)
defines exclusive claim as responsibility, not adjudication or financial authority.
[ADR 0009: Operator verdicts with recorded financial effects](docs/adr/0009-operator-verdicts-with-recorded-financial-effects.md)
defines the separate assigned-operator verdict and recorded-compensation boundary:
valid cases stay pending until actual financial effects succeed; debit compensation
uses owned savings/checking allocation, not an inferred card-account relationship.
Card protection is separately audited and does not imply processor enforcement.
Both services enable `CORSMiddleware` via `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

### `app/business-api/shared/src/banking_shared/`

Owns canonical SQLModel tables such as `Product`, `TransactionRecord`,
`RuntimePosting`, `CardProtection`, `SupportCase` and `SupportCaseEvent`.
Services and ingestion import these persisted types. Service `Account`, `Card`,
`Transaction` and `DisputeCase` models are separate Pydantic DTOs. Stored-field
changes start here and require data-module migrations; API-shape changes belong
in service DTOs. `models/` groups catalog, products, transactions, cases, effects
and historical tables; its initializer registers canonical metadata.
`database.py` owns PostgreSQL engine/session wiring, and `runtime.py` batches
runtime balance/protection projections without changing persisted anchors.

### `app/business-api/data/`

The CSV-to-PostgreSQL ingestion pipeline. `scripts/run_pipeline.py` is the only
normal entry point (EDA, scope approval, loading, verification, in that order).
`scripts/evaluate_fraud_threshold.py` is the offline baseline evaluation for the
dispute triage threshold. This module owns Alembic migrations and historical
assignment archives; canonical tables live in `shared/src/banking_shared`. Source-data
refresh must preserve runtime financial effects.

### `infra/`

Terraform only (no Bicep in this repo). One Linux App Service plan, five App
Services (`identity`, `account`, `transaction`, Responses BFF, `web`), Log Analytics,
Application Insights, PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Key Vault, Blob Storage and a
Foundry account/project. Identity has a dedicated resource
and database-secret reference; consumers use its computed HTTPS hostname. Managed
identities receive secret-scoped access; BFF has no database setting/grant. Root azd
uses explicit service `resourceName` bindings, while standalone Identity CD uses
its name output.
Provisioning, remote DB grants, migrations and coordinated rollout remain separate
acceptance gates; Terraform declarations are not deployed-isolation evidence.

### `app/agent/azure.yaml` vs root `azure.yaml`

Two independent `azd` project roots: the root manifest provisions the App Service
stack via Terraform; `app/agent/azure.yaml` provisions the hosted Foundry agent
separately. Commands against the agent stack need `--cwd app/agent`.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Dual authentication, never conflated.** Identity issues application JWTs;
  customer `jwt_identity.py` and operator identity dependencies verify them and
  check current Identity on every protected REST request, without caching and
  failing closed. `internal_identity.py` verifies the separate 60-second HMAC
  bearer minted fresh per MCP call. Neither substitutes for the other.
- **Authorization lives in `services.py`, not in prompts.** Every method that reads
  or acts on an `accountId`/`productId`/case id re-derives the owner from the
  verified identity and checks it against the resource before doing anything;
  no caller-supplied `customer_id` is ever trusted.
- **Tool schemas and agent instructions stay English-only.** Only the final
  response text is locale-driven, from the authenticated user's stored `locale`
  (`es`/`pt`/`en`, `en` fallback), injected once per request by a context provider,
  never inferred from the current message's language. Human-facing status labels
  are translated without changing canonical transport codes. Frontend catalogs map
  Card to Card/Tarjeta/Cartão; Spanish generated/display terminology uses
  `reclamo`/`reclamos` with masculine grammar. Customer reasons and original audit
  text remain verbatim; frontend catalogs never translate agent Markdown.
- **Dispute legitimacy is never an LLM decision.** `dispute_service.py`'s triage
  is a deterministic routing check against the dataset's precomputed `fraud_score`;
  missing scores stay in review without estimation. The agent's only job is intake
  (identify and confirm the transaction), read-only case consultation and routing.
  `operator_service.py` separately enforces available/assigned lists, owner-only
  detail, atomic exclusive claims, assigned/versioned verdicts, recorded effects
  and case-specific protection. Claim is not a verdict; valid classification stays
  `PENDING_EFFECTS` until compensation is recorded. Real ownership references
  `operators.user_id`; retired simulated assignments remain archives, not verdicts.
- **Testing is per-service, not repo-wide.** `pytest` (`pytest-asyncio`,
  `asyncio_mode = "auto"`) per Python service under its own `tests/`; `vitest` for
  the frontend. There is no single top-level test runner.
- **`uv` is the supported Python tool runner.** Use each service's project context
  with `uv run`/`uv sync`, either from its directory or with explicit
  `--project`/`--directory` options from the repository root.

## Architectural Invariants

- The BFF never queries Account, Transaction, or PostgreSQL financial tables
  directly. If a future change adds that back, it reopens a closed migration
  ([ADR 0005: Direct frontend financial API calls](docs/adr/0005-frontend-calls-account-and-transaction-directly.md)) and needs
  the same explicit sign-off that closed it.
- `plan/` is gitignored and local-only. Nothing under it is ever staged, committed,
  or pushed, regardless of how much planning content accumulates there.
- Account and Transaction are the only conversational specialists.
  The transaction-dispute support case is a tracking/workflow layer over those two
  existing MCP tool surfaces, not a third `HandoffBuilder` participant.
- MCP tools and customer/operator routers stay thin: authenticate and role-gate
  through dependencies, validate input, delegate and shape responses. Services own
  customer-resource ownership, assigned-operator checks and business rules.
- The conversational model never invents an eligibility, fraud, or dispute-outcome
  rule; those are deterministic policy/threshold checks, with the model only
  explaining results already computed by code.
